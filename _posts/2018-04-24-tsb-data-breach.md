>When TSB split from the Lloyds Banking Group, it continued to rent a banking platform from its former owner while it developed its own "state-of-the-art" platform.

>It promised that systems would be back up and running by 6pm on Sunday but many of those who did get access to their online accounts were presented with details of other people's accounts too.

>Since that data breach many customers have reported being unable to log on, while those that have been able to log on say there have been problems with passwords or that they have been logged out.

Ouch. Glad I don’t work on the customer service front line for TSB. It’s hard to see how they’re going to regain the trust of their customers.
