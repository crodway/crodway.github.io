link_title: "UK might have to build a new satellite system after Brexit, government says"
---

> The UK might have to set up its own satellite navigation system if it is thrown out after Brexit, according to officials.

> The Galileo project – a 10 billion euro programme that was launched by the EU to rival the US global positioning system – is leading to intense arguments between the UK and the rest of Europe.

Let's get this out of the way up front: I voted against Brexit, and the stream of news since then about how shoddy a job the government is doing of preparing for it is just depressing. 

Having said that, the thought of developing our own satellite system is pretty exciting, and would hopefully open up a large number of technical jobs for the younger generation.

But our recent history with large infrastructure projects is not great, and given that Galileo has been in development for 15 years, I can't see us getting our version off the ground (pun intended) anytime soon. 

And now we're back to depressed again.
