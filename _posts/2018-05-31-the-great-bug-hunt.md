> Luckily, a pattern was soon detected – albeit a strange one. The game was only crashing overnight on one of the three Xboxes. A search for differences ensued. It wasn’t the power cables. It wasn’t the controllers. It wasn’t the order they were burning the DVDs. Bring the Xbox back to your desk – no crash. Put it back – crash. It was something about the very specific setup QA was using.

This is a really interesting story. If it were me, I would have given up and assumed it was a single faulty hardware unit long before that. One of the many reasons I’m not a software developer by trade!
