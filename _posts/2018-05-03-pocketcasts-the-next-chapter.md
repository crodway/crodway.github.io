>That’s why when a combined group comprised of WNYC, NPR, WBEZ and This American Life approached us with the goal of partnering for the good of the entire podcast industry, we knew that this opportunity was something else entirely.

I’m not sure how to feel about this. I used PocketCasts for years when I was an Android user. Mostly because it was the only good podcast app on the platform. 

The podcast industry seems to be doing just fine at the moment, I don’t see what this mega coalition can really do for its benefit?

Still, Rusty seems to be a pretty down to earth sort of guy, hopefully he can keep the app on the right path.
